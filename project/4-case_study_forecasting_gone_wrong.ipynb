    "Fidget spinners was a hit in school in such an instant time. Manufacturers thought they had hit the jackpot, the production ramped up like crazy. But suddenly, they piled up too many stocks without anyone who wants to buy it. They mistakenly take a fleeting trend as a longlasting trend. When we face a trend, we have to ask ourselves whether it is a longlasting trend or maybe it is just a passing craze."

    "LTCM is like the rock star of the hedge fund world. The idea is to use complex mathematical model to predict market movement. For a while it was like they had found the secret formula. They are able to make money for a while until The Russia Financial Crisis happened in 1998, and the LTCM model didn't expect this to happen. The market crashed and the money is all gone. The markets are wild beast & sometimes they can throw curveball that no algorithm can catch."

    "This was Google's attempt to predict flu outbreak using what people were searching for online. They thought that if people start sarching for flu symptomps, it would indicate that flu outbreak is happening. At first, it seemed like a groundbreaking way to use big data for public health. But it didn't work out. Google flu trends ended up overestimating flu cases, sometimes way off the mark. It turns out that how & why people search up for things can change a lot & Google's search algorithms kept changing too."
